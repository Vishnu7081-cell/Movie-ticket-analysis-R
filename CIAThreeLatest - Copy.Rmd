## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:




```{r load-data, echo=TRUE}
# Set working directory
setwd("C:/Users/HP/Desktop/NewDbsTheater")

# Load datasets
movies <- read.csv("movie.csv")
ratings <- read.csv("rating.csv")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r genre-user-time-analysis, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Separate genres and filter
movie_genres <- movies %>%
  separate_rows(genres, sep = "\\|") %>%
  filter(genres != "(no genres listed)")

# Count ratings per genre
genre_ratings <- ratings %>%
  inner_join(movie_genres, by = "movieId") %>%
  group_by(genres) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

# Plot
ggplot(genre_ratings, aes(x = reorder(genres, count), y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Most Rated Movie Genres", x = "Genre", y = "Number of Ratings")

# Top genre per user
user_pref <- ratings %>%
  inner_join(movie_genres, by = "movieId") %>%
  group_by(userId, genres) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  group_by(userId) %>%
  top_n(1, count) %>%
  ungroup()

# Count how many users prefer each genre
top_genre_counts <- user_pref %>%
  count(genres, sort = TRUE)

# Pie chart
pie(top_genre_counts$n,
    labels = top_genre_counts$genres,
    main = "Most Preferred Genres by Users",
    col = rainbow(length(top_genre_counts$genres)))

# Extract hour from timestamp
ratings$timestamp <- as.POSIXct(ratings$timestamp, origin = "1970-01-01")
ratings$hour <- hour(ratings$timestamp)

# Count by hour
hourly_views <- ratings %>%
  group_by(hour) %>%
  summarise(count = n())

# Plot
ggplot(hourly_views, aes(x = reorder(as.factor(hour), count), y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "orange") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Peak Viewing Hours (Horizontal)", x = "Hour", y = "Number of Ratings") +
  theme_minimal()

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
